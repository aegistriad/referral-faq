        <div class="panel-body">A referral system is a way to help people get involved in a meaningful way to help promote services and products, in our case it's a pressure washing service.      
<br>
<br>
When someone signs up to become a referrer, they will get a unique link that identified only to them. When someone uses that link to book a job, claim a offer, coupon, or get a quote, the referrer is credited that interaction.
<br>
<br>
An incentive is often used to for people to help promote and share the link, in this case the incitive is cash.

        <div class="panel-body"> There are 3 metrics we track from a referrer, clicks, referrals, and bookings. A click is when someone clicks on a link that you share, a referral is when someone claims a offer or coupon, and a booking is when someone books a job and job gets started.
  <br>
  <br>
  The payouts go as follows clicks pay 10 cent per click, referrals, pay $1.00 each, and bookings pay $50 for the first 3 and $10 per booking after that. To help eliminate gaming the system, clicks and referrals coming from the same ip or device will not be counted, and the account may be terminated.
